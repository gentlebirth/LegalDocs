# Procedure for Forum and Social Media Posting & Moderation with Gentlebirth Ethos

## 1. Training & Awareness:
   - **Holistic Training:** Incorporate evidence-based practices, sports psychology, and cognitive behavioral therapy into the training of content creators and moderators to address not just the intellectual but also the emotional aspects of communication.
   - **Mindfulness:** Train team members in mindfulness practices, so they approach their roles with greater presence and compassion.

## 2. Content Creation:
   - **Mindful Communication:** Encourage posters to pause and reflect on their words before posting, ensuring they're communicating with intention and respect.
   - **Positive Affirmations:** When sharing information or stories, especially related to childbirth or health, use positive and empowering language inspired by hypnobirthing techniques.
   - **Evidence-Based Information:** Always back health-related posts with reputable sources, emphasizing the importance of evidence-based practices.

## 3. Content Moderation:
   - **Compassionate Feedback:** If content needs correction, utilize techniques from cognitive behavioral therapy to provide feedback that is constructive, reframing negative or problematic statements into more positive and actionable ones.
   - **Mindful Moderation:** Before acting on a post, moderators should take a moment to breathe and ensure their actions come from a place of clarity and not reaction.

## 4. Engaging with the Community:
   - **Active Listening:** Moderators should practice active listening in discussions, ensuring users feel heard and understood.
   - **Visualization:** Drawing from sports psychology, moderators can visualize peaceful interactions and resolutions, which can guide their actions during heated debates.

## 5. Addressing Controversies:
   - **Relaxation Techniques:** If tensions rise, suggest or guide users in basic relaxation or breathing exercises inspired by hypnobirthing, which can calm the situation.
   - **Reframing Challenges:** Use cognitive behavioral therapy principles to help the community reframe challenges as opportunities for growth and learning.

## 6. Continuous Improvement:
   - **Mindful Reflection:** Periodically take time to reflect on the forum's environment, employing mindfulness techniques to understand the emotional and mental state of the community.
   - **Evidence-Based Updates:** Ensure that updates or changes to guidelines are rooted in evidence and best practices, emphasizing the importance of continuous learning.

## 7. Special Cases:
   - **Holistic Support:** For sensitive topics, especially those related to childbirth, offer resources that combine evidence-based medical advice with techniques from hypnobirthing and sports psychology, ensuring a balanced, holistic approach.
   - **Empathy First:** Always approach discussions, especially sensitive ones, with empathy, recognizing the deep emotions and experiences users might be bringing to the conversation.



## Guidelines for Blocking Users

### **Pre-Blocking Considerations:**

1. **Open Dialogue:** Before considering a block, engage in a conversation with the user to understand their viewpoint. Use active listening and express empathy.
2. **Mindful Assessment:** Ensure decisions are not impulsive. Practice a moment of mindfulness to assess the situation clearly before proceeding.
3. **Warning & Mediation:** If possible, provide warnings or involve a mediator. This provides the user an opportunity to rectify their behavior.

### **Reasons for Blocking:**

1. **Repeated Violations:** If a user consistently violates community guidelines despite warnings and mediation efforts.
2. **Hate Speech & Discrimination:** Any form of communication that promotes hate or discrimination should be dealt with promptly.
3. **Threats & Harassment:** Ensure user safety by taking swift action against threats, doxxing, or any form of harassment.
4. **Spam & Malicious Links:** Block users posting irrelevant, repetitive content or sharing potentially harmful links.

### **Post-Blocking Procedures:**

1. **Notification:** Inform the user about their block, clearly stating the reason. Use language rooted in cognitive behavioral therapy, focusing on the action, not the individual.
2. **Duration:** Clearly specify if the block is temporary and, if so, the duration.
3. **Mindful Communication:** Emphasize positive behavior and provide resources or suggestions that might help them align with the community ethos.
4. **Feedback Loop:** Allow users a channel to communicate after the block, ensuring they have an avenue to express concerns or demonstrate change.

### **Review & Unblocking:**

1. **Regular Assessment:** Periodically review blocked users, especially those on temporary bans.
2. **Reintegration Support:** If a user is unblocked, offer them guidance to reintegrate into the community, perhaps linking them to resources on mindfulness and positive communication.
3. **Community Feedback:** Before unblocking long-term or contentious bans, consider seeking feedback from the community or a selected advisory group.

### **Continuous Improvement:**

1. **Reflect on Decisions:** Regularly analyze the reasons users are blocked to identify if certain issues arise often, indicating a possible gap in community guidelines.
2. **Update & Educate:** Modify guidelines based on evidence-based practices, ensuring they are clear to all members. Regularly educate the community on any changes.
3. **Mental Well-being:** Recognize that blocking can also affect moderators. Ensure they have avenues for support, relaxation, or debriefing after difficult decisions.
