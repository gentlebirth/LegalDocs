# Statement on Enhancing Inclusivity at GentleBirth

At **GentleBirth**, a program used across the globe, we firmly believe in creating an environment where every individual—regardless of their gender, race, sexual orientation, or any other protected class—feels welcomed, valued, and understood. Recognizing the diverse experiences within our community, including those of women, mothers, members of the LGBTQ+ community, and various racial and ethnic backgrounds, we are dedicated to cultivating a space of genuine inclusivity and representation, rooted in biology and science. Given our global reach, it's crucial to represent different languages and cultures. However, we believe in the universal tenets presented here and are confident that our community worldwide will embrace them.

## As part of this commitment, we are taking several essential steps:

- **Collaboration with Expert Organizations:** We are reaching out to respected organizations, including those focusing on LGBTQ+ advocacy, women's rights, racial justice, and other areas of expertise. Their insights will guide us in refining our content guidelines to ensure our materials are sensitive, accurate, and inclusive.

- **Resource Recommendations:** We are on a mission to broaden our understanding and, by extension, the understanding of our community. We're actively seeking educational resources that offer perspectives from all walks of life, ensuring that we stay informed and that our discussions reflect the realities of our diverse community.

- **Public Availability of Guidelines:** Once our content guidelines are updated, they will be transparently published. This approach ensures that everyone in our community, regardless of their geographical location, is aware of our inclusivity standards, fostering mutual respect and understanding.

- **Sensitivity Training:** Our global presence demands that our team understands the nuances of various experiences. We're investing in sensitivity training for all our moderators to ensure that conversations are approached with empathy and knowledge, regardless of the cultural or linguistic context.

- **Open Dialogue and Evidence-Based Sources:** GentleBirth encourages all members to actively participate in discussions. We envision our platform as a haven for open, respectful dialogue, where a multitude of opinions are valued. Our moderators will prioritize evidence-based sources to guide conversations and provide clarity on topics that may lack clear guidance from established communities of practice. We refer to the seminal research by Gribble et al., (2022) for the importance of using sexed language in healthcare. Healthcare serves diverse populations; using accurate language ensures accessibility to everyone, irrespective of their linguistic or educational background.

## Feedback and Continuous Improvement:

We value the collective wisdom of our community and welcome suggestions to enhance our policies. Using this platform, you can contribute your insights and suggestions. While we are anchored in the universal tenets of inclusivity and understanding, we are always open to opinions that will help us better serve our community.

Our journey towards a more inclusive space is ongoing, with continuous reflection, education, and action being integral to our mission. We warmly welcome feedback, guidance, and collaboration from our community and beyond.

**Together, let's make GentleBirth a beacon of inclusivity and understanding for everyone preparing for a positive birth, no matter where they are in the world.**
