# Statement on Enhancing Inclusivity at GentleBirth

At **GentleBirth**, we firmly believe in creating an environment where every individual—regardless of their gender, race, sexual orientation, or any other protected class—feels welcomed, valued, and understood. Recognizing the diverse experiences within our community, including those of women, mothers and members of the LGBTQ+ community, and many racial and ethnic backgrounds, we are dedicated to cultivating a space of genuine inclusivity and representation, based in biology and science.

## As part of this commitment, we are taking several essential steps:

- **Collaboration with Expert Organizations:** We are reaching out to respected organizations, including those focusing on LGBTQ+ advocacy, women's rights, racial justice, and other areas of expertise. Their insights will guide us in refining our content guidelines to ensure our materials are sensitive, accurate, and inclusive.

- **Resource Recommendations:** We are on a mission to broaden our understanding and, by extension, the understanding of our community. We're actively seeking educational resources that offer perspectives from all walks of life, ensuring that we stay informed and that our discussions reflect the realities of our diverse community.

- **Public Availability of Guidelines:** Once our content guidelines are updated, we will publish them transparently. This approach allows everyone in our community to be aware of our inclusivity standards, fostering mutual respect and understanding.

- **Sensitivity Training:** It's crucial for our team to understand the nuances of various experiences. We are investing in sensitivity training for all our moderators to ensure that every conversation is approached with empathy and knowledge.

- **Open Dialogue and Evidence-Based Sources:** GentleBirth encourages all members to actively participate in discussions. We envision our platform as a haven for open, respectful dialogue, where a multitude of opinions is valued. Our moderators will prioritize evidence-based sources to guide conversations and will step in to provide clarity on topics that may not have clear guidance from established communities of practice. We refer to the seminal research by Gribble et al., (2022) regarding the importance of using sexed language in healthcare to guide our language.  Healthcare serves diverse populations, and not everyone has the same level of health literacy or English language skills. Using accurate language ensures that information is accessible to everyone, regardless of their educational background.

Our journey towards creating a more inclusive space is ongoing, and we acknowledge the importance of consistent reflection, education, and meaningful action. We warmly welcome feedback, guidance, and collaboration from our community and beyond.

**Together, let's make GentleBirth a beacon of inclusivity and understanding for every woman preparing for a positive birth.**
